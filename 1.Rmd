```{r}

```
itâ€™s good practice to verify that they do indeed uniquely identify each observation
```{r}
planes %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```
```{r}
weather %>% 
  count(year, month, day, hour, origin) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```
```{r}
flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, flight) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```
```{r}
flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```
```{r}
flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2
```
```{r}
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>% 
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
```
```{r}
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>% 
  mutate(name = airlines$name[match(carrier, airlines$carrier)])
```
